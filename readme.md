# Definitiv OpenSSL

Definitivopenssl tries to bundle all openssl headers from version
1.0.0 to now in on library importable by dlang.

When using this lib all you have to do is to import the version
you want to use and then more importantly, link the openssl library
matching the choosing version.

You do not import individual openssl header, all headers are merged
into one D file.

The D files are generated by the program listed in gendppfile.d.
The successfully generated files are located in source/openssl.

To try to generate them by yourself run:
```sh
make
```

This will take some time.
